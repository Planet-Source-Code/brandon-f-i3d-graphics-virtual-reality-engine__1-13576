## I3D Graphics / Virtual Reality Engine


</div>

### Description

This is a 3D Graphics / Virtual Reality Engine called I3D. It does have some very complex/complicated routines built in, but MOST are easily understandable. This engine is very useful and functional and has powerful mesh controlling routines. It has the ability to load .3DS models, .X files, and .MDL models. It has such features as billboarding(makes texture constantly face user head-on), texture loading, terrain loading, light object creation, collision detection, camera/viewport controls, etc... It has many, many routines for matrix/vector/quaternion math. This 3D engine is even equiped with a particle system.
 
### More Info
 
A major thing to know before running I3D. Actually THIS IS CRITICAL IF THE ENGINE IS TO WORK!!! IN THE I3D.ZIP, THERE IS I3DRUNTIME.ZIP. THIS HOLDS I3D.DLL, AS WELL AS I3DSETUP.EXE. I3D SETUP.EXE MUST BE RUN BEFORE I3D IS USED AS IT SETS UP I3D'S REGISTERED VALUES. ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU REGISTER THE DLL WITH REGSVR32.EXE.

If the source code does not load ALL the files, edit the I3D Project file so it does.

There are no side effects for this engine. But if you do create intensly 3D scenes, you may experience nausea from the intense graphical power of this engine.
